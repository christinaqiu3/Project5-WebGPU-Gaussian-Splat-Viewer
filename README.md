## Overview

This project implements a GPU-driven 3D Gaussian splatting renderer using WebGPU. The goal is to take a set of 3D Gaussians and render high-quality, order-independent, depth-sorted 2D splats (quads) on the screen. The implementation follows the assignment stages: loading scene and camera data, preprocessing Gaussians on the GPU (culling, covariance â†’ 2D conic projection, color evaluation), sorting by depth, and rendering the resulting splats with an indirect draw call.

## Performance Analysis

### Comparing point-cloud and gaussian renderer

The point-cloud renderer displays each point as a simple dot or quad with uniform size and color, producing a sparse and noisy appearance without smooth transitions. It lacks depth-dependent opacity, shading, or blending between nearby points.

The Gaussian renderer, produces smooth, continuous surfaces because each point is rendered as an anisotropic 2D Gaussian ellipse instead of a fixed-size point. The splats blend together, giving a more realistic and soft appearance, especially around regions with dense point samples.
